      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Joel Koford, a 19-year-old with a genuine interest in the interplay between technology and psychology. But don't let that make you think I'm all work and no play - I'm also an avid video gamer who loves to unwind with the latest releases.</p>
      <p>Technology for me is not just about how it works; it's about who it works for. I strongly believe that tech should be user-friendly and designed with an understanding of the people who will be using it. This is where my love for psychology comes into play. I'm passionate about creating tech solutions that aren't just efficient, but respectful and understanding of their users.</p>
      <p>My work experience is varied and has given me a unique perspective. I've flipped burgers at McDonald's, learning the value of teamwork and the importance of stellar customer service. I've also delved into the corporate world during my HR internship at Henniges Automotive, where I got a firsthand look at organizational psychology in action.</p>
      <p>When I'm not absorbed in the latest tech news or exploring new psychological concepts, you can often find me immersed in a video game, whether it's a fast-paced shooter or a complex strategy game. Gaming not only entertains me but also feeds my curiosity about the intersection of technology and user experience.</p>
